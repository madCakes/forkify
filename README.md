## Description

The Forkify Recipe App allows users to search for recipes using the [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/). Users can search and view recipes along with their cooking time and adjust the servings to get updated ingredient quantities. Users can bookmark their favourite recipes which are stored in local storage, and add their own recipes which are automatically placed in the bookmarked recipes window.
